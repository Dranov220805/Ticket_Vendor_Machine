# Ticket_Vendor_Machine
Group assignment about creating a Ticket Vendor Machine System

Following statements are omitted ambiguous requirements for a 
Ticket Vendor Machine to sell a bus/MRT ticket (BenThanh metro)  - part of a Smart Ticketing System. 

- An automated ticket-issuing system sells public transportation (Bus, MRT, etc..). Users select their 
destination and select the mode of payment (such as Credit Card, QR Code payment linked with 
banking system or digital wallet).
- In case of payment with credit card then the ticket vendor machine issues a paper ticket with a 
bar code itself and their credit card account be charged. When the passenger presses the start 
button, a menu display of potential destinations is activated, along with message to him/her to 
select a destination. Once a destination has been selected, he/she is requested to input their 
credit card. When the credit transaction has been validated, the ticket is issued. 
- The same for digital wallet means that the ticket vendor machine will show a QR Code after the 
passenger selecting a route for her/his mobile phone payment.
